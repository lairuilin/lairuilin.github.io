Tak-Wai Chan is the Director of Science and Technology for Learning and the 
Chair and Professor of the Graduate Institute of Network Learning Technology at 
the National Central University of Taiwan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
Over the years, Chan has worked on artificial intelligence in education, 
computer supported collaborative learning, computer mediated interactive 
classrooms, networked learning communities, ubiquitous and mobile learning, and 
more recently digital game and toy based learning. Chan started his research on 
simulated learning companion, a concept he proposed in 1988, which has 
subsequently become an active sub-area of artificial intelligence in education. 
In 1992, Chan and his colleagues expanded learning companion systems to a 
networked social learning system in classroom settings. This was the first 
dedicated classroom-based system in the world to support collaborative learning 
synchronously. This thread of research, either learning with multiple virtual 
characters with different roles or persona simulated in a standalone computer or 
distributed networked system, extended the horizon of intelligent tutoring 
research to computer supported collaborative learning. In 2000, Chan led a 
4-year research project with a budget of USD 14 millions. One of the outcomes of 
that project was EduCities (<a href="http://www.educities.edu.tw/">www.educities.edu.tw</a>), 
which is possibly one of the largest networked learning communities in the world 
with 1.5 million students registered. Another outcome was a series of studies on 
mobile and ubiquitous learning inside and outside classrooms, pioneered by Chan 
and his colleagues.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
Chan is now trying to develop a conceptual framework and foundation for 
realizing the ultimate vision of learning companion research – lifelong learning 
companion. Continuing his interest in computer mediated interactive classrooms, 
Chan and his group are now investigating a series of social learning games such 
as reciprocal peer tutoring, learning by asking a good question, peer quest, and 
team competitive learning games in one-to-one classroom, a classroom that every 
student is equipped with at least a handy computing device with wireless 
capability for mediating face-to-face interactions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
Chan has co-founded conference series ICCEs and GCCCEs, international academic 
societies AACE-APC, GCSCE (<a href="http://www.gcsce.org/">www.gcsce.org</a>), 
and APSCE (<a href="http://www.apsce.net/">www.apsce.net</a>). In 2003, Chan 
initiated a network of world-class researchers, G1:1 (<a href="http://www.g1to1.org/">www.G1to1.org</a>), 
for promoting international collaboration in one-to-one technology enhanced 
learning. Chan has served on editorial boards, as associate editors, or as 
advisory editors, of about ten international journals as well as on project 
review panels in the US and the EU.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
Chan considers himself a global Chinese since he was born and brought up in Hong 
Kong, did his first degree in the UK, got his master and PhD degrees from the 
US, and has been working in Taiwan since 1989. He might retire in Africa some 
day.<br>
