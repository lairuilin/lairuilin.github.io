<IMG SRC="KD.jpg" BORDER=0 align=left ALT="Prof. Chan's picture" hspace=20>Tak-Wai Chan has been working on learning companion systems since it was proposed in 1988 as a part of his doctoral thesis work. Learning companion addresses issues of multiple intelligent agents, social context, and models of collaboration and competition learning activities. Research on learning companion systems research has become one of the major research topics in the area of artificial intelligence in education. In 1992, he and his colleagues developed one of the earliest dedicated network systems to support synchronous game-based collaborative and competitive learning, called Distributed WEST and a sequence of such systems. In 2000, Chan led a research project for promoting university excellence, called active social learning and its application. In that project, there are with over 30 professors and more than 200 graduate students and full time assistants involved with a funding budget 14 million US dollars for 4 years. One of the products of that project is the perhaps largest network learning community, called EduCtities. There are 1.3 million of students involved in that learning community. The project studies issues of active social learning in the future network society and develop various learning technologies, including wireless and mobile technologies, handheld computers, intelligent agents, multimedia, etc. Another product is his team's contribution in an emerging area, namely, the wireless and mobile technologies in education. Chan's recent interest is pedagogy design of one-on-one educational computing inside classrooms. One-on-one educational computing means the design of a learning activity or an environment in which one student is equipped with one computing device supported with wireless communication capability.
<p>
Chan, throughout his career, has been promoting the researcher communities in this research area in Taiwan, Greater China, Asia-Pacific region, and for a global network of researchers interested in one-on-one educational computing. For Taiwan, he has been the coordinator of the Information Technology in Education Program of National Science Council from 1994 to 2002. Chan was also the chief architect of the Master Plan of using information technology in K12 education for the Minister of Education of Taiwan, launched in 2001. He also helped initiate and designed a cross-ministry National Science and Technology Program for E-Learning for 5 years, starting from 2003, with a budget of 130 million US dollars.
<p>
For Greater China, Chan, together with other researchers from China, founded the Global Chinese Conference on Computers in Education (GCCCE) in 1997. This conference series has been held in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Beijing, and Nanjing. Currently, Chan is the President of Global Chinese Society of Computers in Education (GCSCE, <A HREF="http://www.gcsce.org/">www.gcsce.org</A>) that monitors GCCCE and Global Chinese Journal on Computers in Education (GCJCE).
<p>
For Asia-Pacific region, Chan was the originator of the Asia-Pacific region based conference series, International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE). The conference has become the most prestigious annual conference in that region and has been held in Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Australia, and Taiwan. He is now responsible to manage headquarter of Asia-Pacfic Society of Computers in Education (APSCE), the society that monitors the ICCEs and an upcoming journal for the Society.
<p>
For the emerging one-on-one educational computing research area, Chan has recently Chan initiated a global network of collaborative researchers on one-on-one educational computing (see <A HREF="http://www.g1on1.org/">www.g1on1.org</A> ).
<p>
Chan is the organizer of conference ICCE1993, program co-chair of ICCE1998, IEEE WMTE2004, conference chair of GCCCE series, CSCL2005, and ITS2006.
