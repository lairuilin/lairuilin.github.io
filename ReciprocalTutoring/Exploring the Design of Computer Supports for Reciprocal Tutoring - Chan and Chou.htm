<CENTER></CENTER>
<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>This paper explores the design of a set of system 
prototypes for supporting a protocol of cooperative learning activity called 
reciprocal tutoring. During reciprocal tutoring, two or more agents in 
centralized or distributed environments interact as they take turns at playing 
the roles of a tutor and a tutee in solving Lisp recursive problems. These 
agents are either real students or virtual learning companions simulated by the 
computer. Furthermore, in the design of a virtual tutee, which is one of the 
roles assumed by the virtual learning companion, we found that the student model 
plays a critical role in adaptive interaction with the student, thus broadening 
the applicability of the student model in one-on-one tutoring settings. 
Preliminary experimental trials of these systems have been conducted.

<P><B>1. Introduction</B> 
<P> 
<P>In early computer assisted learning research, the question "Should the 
computer teach the student or vice-versa?" was first raised by Luehrmann (1972) 
when he argued that, like reading and writing, computing constitutes a new and 
fundamental intellectual resource that should not be a mere delivery system for 
instruction. Students should learn how to employ computing as a resource for 
learning. By teaching or instructing the computer through computing, students 
may learn more about the process of learning than they do from being tutored by 
software written by others. Taylor (1980) further elaborated that a computer can 
be conceived as a <I>tutor</I>, a <I>tutee</I>, a <I>tool</I>, or a <I>toy</I>. 
We should note that sometimes it may not be easy to distinguish these three 
traits of computers, for example, whether Logo is tool, a toy, or a tutee. 
However, the differentiation of these traits is useful to designers in 
identifying their goals and developing the characteristics in computer software 
that they want to portrait to the users. In addition, the advancement of 
multimedia and network technology today enables the computer to be an 
interactive <I>textbook </I>with multimedia as well as an 
<I>telecommunicator</I>. Thus computer and network resemble 6T. 
<P> 
<P>In educational psychology studies, the <I>reciprocal teaching</I> method 
(Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984; Brown, 1992) is a prominent model employed in 
reading comprehension. It was modeled after studies of Socratic or inquiry 
teaching (Collins and Stevens, 1982), but in a peer group setting. Participants 
take turns as a learning leader, who begins by asking a question and ends by 
summarizing the gist of what has been read. The group rereads and discusses 
possible problems of interpretation when necessary. Questioning provides the 
impetus to get the discussion going. Summarizing at the end of a period of 
discussion helps students establish where they are in preparation for tackling a 
new segment of text. Attempts to clarify any comprehension problems that might 
occur arise opportunistically, and the leaders ask for predictions about future 
content. These four activities -- questioning, clarifying, summarizing, and 
predicting -- bolster the discussion because they are comprehension-monitoring 
devices. The model is recently being combined with Jigsaw method (Aronson, 1978) 
in fostering a community of learners (Brown, et al., 1993) that features 
students as designers of their own learning and engages students in 
self-reflective learning and critical inquiry in an intentional learning 
classroom (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1991). 
<P> 
<P>Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) research, as indicated by its name, 
intends to mimic the process of private tutoring in a computer supported 
environment. While tutoring is a useful metaphor for describing human computer 
interaction for learning, Chan and Baskin (1988, 1990) appealed to the computer 
to impersonate explicitly multiple artificial agents: a teacher and a 
<I>learning companion</I>. Also, researchers like Self (1988) advocate that the 
student may undertake collaborative learning with the computer. Prototypes of 
these alternatives to ITSs have been developed. Integration-Kid, a learning 
companion system, explores various patterns of interactions through different 
protocols of learning activities among the agents, such as cooperation, 
competition, and reciprocally working and observing (Chan, 1991). The 
performance of the learning companion is governed by a subset of problem solving 
expertise and some faulty knowledge. During the learning process, this problem 
solving expertise is expanded and the faulty knowledge is tuned by simply 
deleting and adding knowledge units. People Power and Wombat are collaborative 
learning systems where a computer takes the role of a collaborator (Dillenbourg 
and Self, 1992; Blandford, 1994). These systems investigate how the computer and 
the student co-generate reflective social dialogue through argumentation or 
negotiation. 
<P>Of particular interest to this work is a protocol of learning activity where 
the student "learns how to learn by teaching the learning companion" (Chan and 
Baskin, 1988, p.199). This model is also called <I>learning by teaching</I> and 
was elaborated by Palthepu, Greer, and McCalla (1991) who describe a system 
architecture in a declarative domain represented by a semantic network. The 
system acts as an interactive knowledge acquisition tool and asks the student 
questions in order to complete the inheritance hierarchies. They speculate that 
such a system would be useful to a student who 'almost knows' the domain and 
that the system would enhance the student's meta-cognitive reasoning skills. 
They found that student modeling seemed to be less useful and put it as an 
interesting open question whether student modeling is critical in learning by 
teaching. Following such a <I>tabula rasa </I>approach, Nichols (1994) developed 
a system and found that subjects who tested the system expressed "discomfort at 
having to feed a 'knowledge-hungry' agent." 
<P>Instead of using such <I>pure</I> co-learners, VanLehn, Ohlsson, and Nason 
(1994) suggested that a more complex system could use covert experts and 
pedagogical modules to move the dialogue in a pedagogically useful direction. 
Besides being a learning partner of the student, a simulated student can 
potentially be useful for formative evaluation of an instructional designer's 
prototypes and teacher training. This task is called 'meta-tutoring' (VanLehn, 
Ohlsson, and Nason, 1994; VanLehn, 1993). Ur and VanLehn (1994) applied 
explanation-based machine learning methods to simulate a physics student for the 
purpose of tutor training and used it to study the cognitive process of learning 
from a tutor. 
<P> 
<P>Computer support for peer learning is not restricted to centralized systems. 
Distributed systems that support multiple agents to take different roles to 
interact over connected machines are being studied (Chan et al., 1992; McManus 
and Aiken 1993; Jehng et al., 1994). Indeed, distance learning environments in 
the future will need artificial learning companions to ensure their 
accessibility if there is no appropriate learning partner available on-line. For 
some learning activities, the artificial learning companions together with the 
real students on the network can form a virtual learning group (Chan &amp; Lai, 
1995). 
<P> 
<P>This paper first explores the design of a set of reciprocal tutoring 
environments to practice Lisp recursion. <I>Reciprocal tutoring is a protocol of 
learning activity, where two or three agents (an agent is a computer or a 
student) take turns to play the roles of a 'tutor' and a 'tutee'</I>. Next, we 
construct a Petal-Like-System (Bhuiyan, Greer, and McCalla, 1992) to provide a 
scaffolding tool for the student by exploiting the computing power of the 
machine to perform parts of the learning task for the students. Finally, like 
most ITSs, we employ student modeling as the basis to deal with students' 
difficulties that emerge during problem solving, enabling adaptive interactions 
between agents. For example, in one of the reciprocal tutoring environments, the 
student model is used as an intelligent tool for a student to tutor another 
student through a connected machine. In another environment, we use the student 
model to implement a virtual learning companion. The rest of this paper is 
organized in the following way: After discussing the various reciprocal tutoring 
configurations, we describe different supports for a set of reciprocal tutoring 
systems. Then we discuss experimental trials of these systems. Finally, after 
more discussions and future work, we arrive at a few conclusions. 
<P> 
<P><B>2. Variations of Reciprocal Tutoring</B> 
<P>&nbsp;Reciprocal tutoring is a form of cooperative learning by adopting the 
'divide and conquer' strategy. A learning task is partitioned into sub-tasks of 
tutoring and 'tuteeing' where tuteeing is learning by working on the solution 
while being tutored. These sub-tasks are distributed to different agents and 
each agent is responsible for a sub-task, while the rest of the work is taken 
care of by other agents. Integration-Kid (Chan, 1991) supports a close 
approximation of the reciprocal tutoring protocol where the virtual learning 
companion and the student reciprocally works and observes each other on 
different problems. If the observer is more capable or knows the answer to offer 
helpful comments, then it would become reciprocal tutoring. In contrast to 
reciprocal teaching in the domain of reading comprehension, the learning task of 
Lisp recursion can not be decomposed into many significant sub-tasks without 
lessening the importance of each agent's role. 
<P> 
<P>In general, we may consider: agents, which are either real (human) or virtual 
(computer simulated); roles, which are either tutor or tutee (learner); and 
location, which is either centralized (a single human student interacting with a 
computer) or distributed (multiple human students in different places connected 
by a network). If there are only two agents involved in the learning environment 
and if we let R, V, T, and L denote real, virtual, tutor, and learner, 
respectively, then we can envisage 10 possible configurations: 
<P> 
<P>RL+RL RT+RT 
<P>&nbsp;RL+VL RT+VT 
<P>&nbsp;RL+VT VL+VL 
<P>&nbsp;RT+RL VT+VL 
<P>&nbsp;RT+VL VT+VT 
<P> 
<P>Clearly we are not interested in configurations in which all agents are 
virtual or in which all roles are tutors, therefore the second column of the 
above list will not be considered. Co-exist collaboration where human students 
work together using a standalone computer is not within the scope of discussion 
in this paper. Therefore, if there are multiple real students involved, then we 
assume a distributed environment. Now let us consider the first configuration, 
RL+RL, the configuration simply means that the two students collaborate (or 
compete) and communicate with two connected computers. TurtleGraph (Jehng, et 
al., 1994) is such a system, when difficulty arises, the two connected students 
are encouraged to communicate and discuss the solution. The second combination 
RL+VL is a form of collaborative learning between the student and the computer. 
This type of system was suggested by Self (1988) and is exemplified by the 
People Power system (Dillenbourg &amp; Self, 1992). The third combination RL+VT 
is the usual ITS model. The fourth one, RT+RL, distributes two different roles, 
tutor and learner, to students. The last one, RT+VL, is the inverted model of 
the ITS discussed above referred to as the <I>learning by tutoring</I> model, 
which puts the student in the position of a tutor. We shall come back to discuss 
these last they combinations because they involve T and L roles. 
<P> 
<P>If three agents are involved there will be 20 possible configurations. We 
shall discuss some of the relevant models. RL+VT+VL is essentially the original 
learning companion system model. RT+RL+RL involves three students, one of whom 
serves as a peer tutor who may have more advanced skills, perhaps only because 
of computer support. RT+VL+VL is an extension of the learning by tutoring model 
in which the student now instructs or monitors two computer learners. RT+RL+VT 
is a model in which the VT is a meta-tutor, that is, VT helps RT to tutor RL. 
But if the RT knows more than the RL and has some good knowledge about the 
domain, then a VT may not be necessary. 
<P> 
<P>For more than three agents, there are many more combinations. But we can 
still discuss several relevant models. Three's Company (Chan, 1995), 
RL+VT+VL+VL, is a direct extension of the learning companion system model. In a 
further extension of the Three's Company system Glassroom (Chan, 1995), has 
configured a scenario which involves the combination RL+VT+VL+VL+VT+VL+VL. The 
additional virtual learning sub-group VT+VL+VL in Glassroom is observed by 
another group, RL+VT+VL+VL, which is in fact a Three's Company group. In 
Distributed West (Chan, et al., 1992), two connected students collaborate to 
play against the computer (RL+RL+VL) or compete against each other with the help 
of a private tutor for each student (RL+RL+VT+VT). In the group leader paradigm 
(McManus &amp; Aiken, 1993), the computer is the leader in coordinating the 
activities of a group of students, represented by the combination VT+RL+RL+.... 
In Contest-Kids (Chan &amp; Lai, 1995), a group of students of unlimited number 
play a competitive game, represented symbolically by RL+RL+RL+.... 
<P> 
<P>Since we are interested in the concept of reciprocal tutoring, we will only 
consider those configurations in which the roles of T and L and agents take 
turns or reciprocate in their activities. In particular, we shall study seven 
models. Many of these models involve the use of two tools. The first tool is an 
intelligent tool, called Diagnosis-Hint-Tree, is developed for the student 
tutor. It can be used to locate the tutee's error and generate a variety of 
hints in a menu for the student tutor to choose. Once the student tutor picks a 
hint, this hint will be sent to the tutee. The second tool, called the 
Petal-Like-System, is developed for the tutee. It is a nicely designed 
scaffolding tool to help students to construct the Lisp program and solution. 
Detailed discussion of the Diagnosis-Hint-Tree and the Petal-Like-System will be 
in next section. 
<P> 
<P>The first model, called the <I>distributed reciprocal tutoring</I> system 
(DRT), is represented by the combination RT+RL+VT. The system allows two 
students (a dyad) to work cooperatively but separately on two connected machines 
to solve problems (see Figure 1). One plays the role of a 'tutee' while the 
other assumes the role of a 'tutor'. The students take turns in these roles in 
different problems. While the tutee is working on a problem, the tutor, who 
knows the answer, is watching how the tutee works. However, knowing the answer 
is not enough; when the tutee faces difficulties or makes errors, the tutor, who 
is not necessarily more capable than the tutee, may not be able to offer help. A 
natural way to handle this situation is to provide an intelligent 'super-tutor', 
VT, to help the student tutor to assist the tutee in problem solving. The role 
of the super tutor is to make sure that the student tutor knows where the 
tutee's difficulty lies and to offer relevant help in the tutoring process. 
Instead of implementing an 'active' super-tutor agent who informs the student 
tutor of the tutee's mistakes, an alternative approach is adopted.

<P>The second model is also a distributed system called the <I>distributed 
responsibility sharing</I> system (DRS). It is represented by the combination, 
RT+RL+RL, which involves a triad of three human students, who take turns playing 
different roles (see Figure 2). The solution construction task in DRS is shared 
by two students. DRS is a twofold reciprocal tutoring system. One student plays 
the role of 'designer' who uses a Petal-Like-System, another student plays the 
role of a tutor and, like DRT, uses the Diagnosis-Hint-Tree to assist the 
designer. After the designer obtains a solution approved by the tutor, the 
solution is passed to another student, who plays the role of 'translator', to 
translate the program into Lisp, again, via another Petal-Like-System. The tutor 
mainly helps the translator use the correct Lisp syntax in the process.

<P>The third model is the combination of ITS and <I>Learning By Teaching</I> 
(LBT), that is, the student and the computer switch their roles of R and L for 
alternate problems. We call this a <I>centralized reciprocal tutoring</I> system 
(CRT). The ITS and Learning By Teaching models are included as the fourth and 
fifth models for comparison. In an ITS, students use a Petal-Like-System to 
construct Lisp programs. When there are mistakes, a student model is used to 
offer hints directly to the student. The student model lies inside the system 
and is hidden from the student. In LBT, the computer plays the role of a tutee, 
being tutored by the student. The configuration of LBT can also be RT+VT+VL, 
where VT may help RT to tutor VL. In this configuration, a virtual companion, 
who delineates the sub-optimal performance of a tutee, and a virtual tutor, 
which helps the student tutor, are used. To tutor the virtual learning 
companion, like the student tutor in DRT, a Diagnosis-Hint-Tree is used by the 
student. Indeed, if we were only interested in pure tutoring and pure tuteeing, 
we could have modified the DRT model by canceling the role-switching part of the 
activity. However, we are more interested in comparing traditional ITSs with 
other systems. Therefore, we will study the two sub-systems, ITS and LBT, of the 
CRT system separately and then compare them with the CRT system itself. 
<P> 
<P>In an ITS, a computer tutor diagnoses and gives hints directly to students. 
In fact, an interface for the student may be provided to locate and diagnose her 
mistakes before the system generates hints. So the student is more active and 
the computer is more passive when the student debugs the program. We shall call 
this sixth system, a modified version of ITS, the <I>self-diagnosing</I> system 
(SD). In SD, like ITS, students use the Petal-Like-System to construct Lisp 
programs. When errors are encountered or help is needed, they use 
Diagnosis-Hint-Tree to spot their own errors and receive hints from the student 
model. The student model used in SD is similar to the student model used for 
teaching Portuguese (Bull, Pain, and Brna, 1993) where the student can inspect 
and modify the student model through user/system negotiation. Finally, we 
consider a single agent (RL) model in which the student is a learner who works 
alone (WA) and the computer only provides the Petal-Like-System tool. 
<P> 
<P><B>3. Supports for Reciprocal Tutoring</B> 
<P> 
<P>In our observations of mathematics problem solving using paper and pencil 
(Chan, 1989), we noticed that students go through several learning stages. At 
the beginning, they acquire relevant unfamiliar information from demonstrated 
examples, in particular, they focus on the syntax or the form of problem 
solutions in examples. At a certain point, when the student starts to relieve 
from the burden of syntactic details, a process of learning to understand more 
about the essential parts of the problem begins. Slowly, their emphasis shifts 
from accurate description towards effectiveness. For example, steps which would 
shorten the solution path are considered. As problems become more complex, 
students increasingly integrate the newly learned technique with previously 
learned knowledge. In short, the student's learning evolves from recognizing new 
knowledge to gradually increasing control over that knowledge. In most problem 
domains, even learning a simple task at the beginning, there are many elements 
to master. If students have to handle the whole learning task at the outset, 
they will inevitably encounter difficulties. Therefore, in computer assisted 
learning, designing a set of computer or human supports is crucial. These 
supports serve to enable the learning processes to proceed steadily. Indeed, 
given a limited amount of a learning resource, such as time, students should be 
rewarded by maximizing their learning instead of wasting effort by unnecessary 
struggle at a certain point or because of overwhelming problem complexity. It is 
the design that leads us to recognize various concerns and put all these 
concerns together in creative flux to build a learning environment. In this 
section, we shall explain the details of the implementation of these supports in 
reciprocal tutoring. 
<P> 
<P><B>3.1 Cognitive Load Sharing</B> 
<P>&nbsp;Cognitive load sharing is a salient feature of most of the systems 
considered in this paper. In writing a Lisp recursive problem, a student seek an 
approach and then constructs a program. If errors are found, the program is 
diagnosed, alternatives are made, possible errors are corrected, the program is 
modified or reconstructed. If there are errors in a modified program, the 
diagnostic process is repeated (see Figure 3). Note, in most ITSs, the first two 
sub-processes and the last two sub-processes are performed by the student while 
the two sub-processes in the middle are carried out by the computer. In 
reciprocal tutoring (e.g. DRT), the middle two sub-processes are executed by 
another student instead. Therefore, both usual human tutoring and reciprocal 
tutoring can be regarded as a cooperative learning process. 
<P>Basically, reciprocal tutoring seeks to add a social element to the 
spontaneous process of learning by doing and encourages students to reflect and 
compare as she observes her own and her partner's learning processes. Learning 
in reciprocal tutoring, therefore, can be characterized as a cyclical process of 
construction and reflection.

<P><B>3.2 Petal-Like-System</B> 
<P>&nbsp;In apprenticeship learning, scaffolding refers to the assistance 
offered to students by the expert in the process of accomplishing a complex 
learning task (Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). The expert completes those 
parts of the task that students have not yet mastered. In other words, students 
participate in the task only to the degree that they can manage and with the 
amount of responsibility that they are capable of assuming. Scaffolding is 
temporary and matches the level of mastery of the students. At a later stage of 
learning, the process of fading proceeds, that is, the expert's support is 
gradually removed when students learn to handle more of the task on their own 
and students are increasingly asked to make up for the missing parts that were 
being supported. When scaffolding is employed in a computer based learning 
environment, it refers to the facilities offered by the computer. This is 
usually done by providing a tool that employs the computing capability of the 
machine to share a learning sub-task and leaves the rest to the student. This 
can then reduce the task complexity to the student. We call such a tool a 
<I>scaffolding tool</I> 
<P> 
<P>Most systems described in this paper are supported by a Petal-Like-System 
(PLS), a typical scaffolding tool. PLS is a part of the Petal system, called 
PET1 (Bhuiyan, Greer, and McCalla, 1992). PET1 originally provided a mental 
model-based programming environment to free students from dealing with the 
syntax problem since there is a set of Lisp 'code chunks' (or expression 
templates) displayed as buttons on the screen (%t and %f are the Boolean values 
true and false in our small Lisp language). These code chunks allow the student 
to construct code without making syntactic errors. Thus, students do not worry 
about the formal details or legality of the expressions and can pay more 
attention to the semantics and the heuristic knowledge required for developing a 
solution. In addition, several advantages of PLS that were not described in the 
original paper are revealed. We shall describe them here: 
<P> 
<UL>
  <LI>PLS in fact employs the calculator metaphor which obeys almost all of the 
  good user interface principles (Smith, Cypher, &amp; Spohrer, 1994). It allows 
  students to produce code by invoking a sequence of actions and examining their 
  effects. When the code is what they want, they stop. These actions are not 
  performed by memorizing and typing, but by seeing and pointing -- a hand-eye 
  coordinated direct manipulation. The calculator metaphor visualizes 
  information for understanding what is going on and what to do next. Indeed, 
  with proper re-framing of the domain, most problem solving domains can use 
  such a calculator metaphor since they usually require a set of operators to 
  transform the problem state until a solution is reached. 
  <LI>PLS provides handy problem solving management. The tutee does not need to 
  write the Lisp constructs such as 'defun' and 'cond' as well as the function 
  name and the argument list, but only focuses on filling in the content of the 
  conditional clauses. When the tutee finishes a problem, the system will take 
  up the finished code, obtain the other necessary parts of a complete program 
  from the system and test the program with examples using a Lisp interpreter. 
  <LI>PLS requires the student to specify which case -- base or recursive -- is 
  going to be dealt with in the next conditional clause. This reminds the 
  student that in solving a recursive problem, two cases, and only these two 
  cases, have to be tackled, though a problem could have multiple base cases and 
  recursive cases. 
  <LI>The restriction of using a single 'cond' construct implies that this 
  construct is by itself a schema that suffices to solve a set of recursive 
  problems. We noticed that students using a Lisp language interpreter tended to 
  try more than one 'cond' and sometimes combined a 'cond' with an 'if' 
  construct. However, it turns out that solutions using a single 'cond' 
  construct are usually the most readable and elegant. </LI></UL>

<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>
<P>Since PLS handles the syntax of the language as well as some other peripheral 
support required to manage the learning task, the space of possible errors made 
by the tutee in writing Lisp recursion code is reduced. This allows the tutee to 
get on with the important features of Lisp recursion problems more easily and 
enables the tutor to focus on the tutee's essential errors. First, using the 
code chunk buttons instead of the keyboard, PLS cuts down dramatically on the 
space of the student's possible responses. Suppose a Lisp expression is composed 
of 5 code chunks and assume that there are 20 code chunks on the screen, then 
the number of possible responses is 20<SUP>5</SUP>. If students use a keyboard, 
assuming that there are 30 characters on the keyboard and on average 5 
characters are required to form a code chunk, then there can be 30<SUP>25</SUP> 
possible responses. To the system, a student's response is either expected or 
unexpected and either correct or incorrect (see Figure 5). The use of PLS 
significantly reduces the number of unexpected responses, which consist syntax 
errors, such as typing or careless mistakes. This permits the system to 
concentrate most on responses that are expected, no matter whether they are 
correct or incorrect. Second, by restricting students to the use of a single 
'cond' construct, PLS diminishes the number of possible correct solutions to one 
or two. This, in turn, reduces the complexity of the relationship between the 
student and the learning companion and simplifies the design of the student 
model.

Expectation</CENTER>

<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>The PLS described thus far is used in all systems except 
the DRS. There are two variations of PLSs used, the PLS-SNL and the PLS-KEY. The 
designer uses PLS-SNL when the code chunks are expressed in a 
<U>S</U>emi-<U>N</U>atural <U>L</U>anguage syntax instead of Lisp syntax. The 
premise is that this language is closer to the mental model of the student, and 
thus it is easier to express the problem solution in this language than in the 
symbolic Lisp language. This is also similar to the idea of PET2 in the original 
Petal system. The 'translator' uses another Petal-like system, PLS-KEY, where 
the code chunk has to be <U>KEY</U>ed in by the translator. The 'tutor', like 
tutors in other systems, uses the Diagnosis-Hint-Tree as an interface. 
<P> 
<P>Figure 6 shows the interface of the translator observing the solution of the 
designer. The third line of code in the top right rectangle of the semi-natural 
language solution of the designer in Figure 6 is: "if the above are all false, 
then return[call: findb?, arguments: the tail of lst]."

<P><B>3.3 Virtual Tutor</B> 
<P>&nbsp;Assistance offered in a cooperative learning environment is usually 
performed by reducing the cognitive load or by facilitating performance. Instead 
of deleting learning elements in reducing cognitive load, facilitating 
performance can be achieved by adding new learning elements for the student. 
These new elements enhance learning performance and allow the student to proceed 
more smoothly with the learning task. The advice or suggestions given by a 
virtual tutor are examples of this kind of assistance. 
<P>Tutoring is an adaptive interaction process. By adaptive interaction, we mean 
interaction that can facilitate changes in the learning environment which 
correspond to the varying and changing needs of different agents over time. 
Through this interaction, students receive information to dismiss doubts and 
overcome difficulties encountered during problem solving. Adaptive information 
allows students to proceed steadily with the problem solving and prevents 
cognitive roadblocks -- getting stuck. To support such interaction, we must 
understand the student's problem situation and thus some kind of student model 
is needed. To simulate a tutor, like other ITSs, we implement a student model. 
If the computer plays the role of a tutor, advice or hints are generated from 
the student model. If a student plays the role of a tutor, the 
Diagnosis-Hint-Tree is provided as an interface on top of the student model. 
With the Diagnosis-Hint-Tree, the human tutor can explore and locate the current 
trouble of the tutee and use it to supply relevant hints to the tutee. Thus, the 
student model inside the computer acts as a 'super-tutor' to the student tutor, 
but in a rather passive form. 
<P> 
<P>As noted before, the use of the scaffolding tool, PLS, significantly shrinks 
the space of student responses. In building the student model, we collected 
error data from many students using the scaffolding tool. A discrimination net 
was then developed for each problem based on the correct solution and the 
collected error data. Each node in the net represents a problem situation that 
might occur in a student's partial program and stores different levels of hints 
and suggestions. When the student requests a hint, the student's solution is 
matched with the net. On termination of the matching at a certain node, the 
current situation of the student's program is recognized and the associated 
hints are then available for the tutor to deliver. Using the schema (a single 
'cond') constrained by the PLS, the problem's latitude has been narrowed to one 
or two possible correct solutions, so the discrimination net is rather linear. 
The disadvantage of this approach is that each problem needs a discrimination 
net. The size of each net is rather large and is thus labor intensive to build. 
Nevertheless, this student model suffices to provide the computer with the 
ability to keep track of the student's actions and point out the tutee's errors 
and supply hints about how and what to do next in solving a problem. 
<P> 
<P><B>3.4 Diagnosis-Hint-Tree</B> 
<P>&nbsp;The Diagnosis-Hint-Tree (DHT) is an interface enabling the human tutor 
to interact with the student model in carrying out the tutoring task. Thus DHT 
is a scaffolding tool for the tutor. The human tutor can see the correct 
solution and the partial solution as well as every action of the virtual or real 
tutee (see Figure 7). The tutor cannot interrupt but waits for the tutee to ask 
for help or check a 'conditional clause' -- a line of code including the 
'condition' and the 'action' parts -- when the tutee finishes writing the 
clause. When the tutee asks for help, the tutor does two things: locates the 
tutee's trouble and chooses a hint to give. The tutor expands the 
Diagnosis-Hint-Tree, starting from the 'base case' or 'recursive case' nodes 
(that are displayed as buttons on the screen). The tutor is required to pick the 
correct path in expanding the DHT. Nodes will not expand if the tutor hits the 
wrong button. When the tutor has successfully spotted the student's trouble, a 
number of hints (in Chinese)<A href="#">[2]</A> are available at the end of the path. The system uses a 
student model to determine whether the tutor has hit the 'right' or 'wrong' 
button. The hints explain errors, suggest possible approaches or Lisp functions 
to be used, or offer answers directly. The tutor will pick a hint and send it to 
the tutee. If 'more hint' is requested by the tutee, the tutor will send another 
one. A point system is used to encourage the human tutor not to depend too much 
on the hints in the DHT and to pay more attention to the tutee throughout the 
tutoring process. Points are scored or deducted according to the performance of 
the tutor in locating the tutee's errors and penalties are given for using hints 
that are too close to the answers.

<P><B>3.5 Virtual Tutee (Learner)</B> 
<P>&nbsp;To simulate a tutee, we have to model the behavior of a learner whose 
overall knowledge of the domain appears to be advancing despite occasional 
mistakes. The tutee's response may be incorrect. Sometimes the tutee may not be 
able to respond and asks for help. Thus, two objectives have to be fulfilled: 
the ability to model the evolving knowledge of the tutee and the modeling 
appearing to be 'psychologically plausible' to the student tutor. By 
psychological plausibility, we mean that the learning behavior and performance 
of the tutee must be understandable to the student. Instead of applying machine 
learning methods to empower the learning ability of the tutee, we take an 
overlay approach to enable the tutee to pretend to learn at about the level of 
an average student. 
<P>For each problem, the simulation of the tutee will refer to five components 
of the system: (i) a <I>tutee model</I>, (ii) a decomposed solution, (iii) the 
tutor's hints, (iv) the error code base, and (v) a set of response rules. The 
tutee model is a set of all the concepts of the domain and their proficiency 
values. It records the tutee's degree of understanding or competence in the 
domain. A decomposed solution is a list of code chunks decomposed from a 
solution of the problem. Each code chunk is associated with the required 
concepts. A tutor's hint, though in natural language form, can be analyzed to 
determine whether it indicates a concept of that code chunk. The error code base 
is formed by collecting mistakes of students in previous empirical experiments. 
Response rules are heuristic rules that govern the responses of the tutee. 
Detailed discussion of the simulation of a virtual tutee is out of the scope of 
this paper (for full description of the simulation of a virtual tutee see Chan 
&amp; Chou, 1995). 
<P> 
<P>The systems are implemented in SuperCard and Mac Lisp on MacQuadra and 
PowerMac, using AppleEvent to link the two application programs. A small Lisp 
interpreter written in Lisp is used for testing a student's program and the 
student may use it to verify the properties of the Lisp language constructs. 
Distributed Systems use AppleTalk to connect. 
<P> 
<P>Table 1 is a summary of the supports for human students. The Companion(s) 
column refers to agents other than the student. The Task(s) column refers to the 
task(s) that the student may undertake. If the student does both tutoring and 
tuteeing, then the student will be involved with both spontaneous and reflective 
learning processes. The student may select only one of these tasks and leave the 
other to the computer or undergo both types of learning simultaneously as in 
'working alone' (WA) model. For the first two systems, DRT and DRS, computers 
also serve as communicators between students. The DRS system provides the 
maximum support to the user and WA the minimum. There is slight difference 
between ITS and SD, the former uses an active virtual tutor and the later uses 
DHT, a passive virtual tutor. In the DRT, DRS, CRT, and LBT systems, DHT acts as 
the super-tutor of the student tutor.

<P>The learning effectiveness of these systems were measured by a posttest after 
students' use of the system. A class of freshmen learning basic Lisp concepts 
used the systems to practice Lisp recursion problems for two hours. Their 
mid-term examination results were taken as a pretest and the students were 
distributed evenly in different systems according to their pretest result. Each 
system version was used by at least 5 subjects who all took a posttest with a 
Lisp language interpreter. Table 2 shows the resulting posttest scores.

of subjects per system, the preliminary evaluation can only provide us with 
possible hypotheses concerning the effectiveness of reciprocal tutoring with no 
definite conclusion. Nevertheless, to facilitate our discussion of likely 
hypotheses, we investigate three perspectives of reciprocal tutoring. 
<P><B>4.1 Virtual vs. Real Companion</B> 
<P>&nbsp;The first perspective we are interested in is the possible difference 
between a virtual learning companion and a real learning companion. For this, we 
found that DRT students seemed to out-perform CRT students (Table 3). Does this 
suggest that the virtual learning companion possesses any deficiency when 
compared to the real learning companion? This may not be the case because we 
succeeded to fool two students by asking them to use DRT, in fact, they used two 
CRTs independently (more discussion of this in next section). This indicates 
that the cognitive benefits due to peer interactions may involve other 
psychological factors other than pure cognition. For example, real learning 
companions may draw more of students' attention, creating better performance 
under peer pressure. The discovery of the attributes that contribute to the 
difference might help to improve the virtual learning companion's ability to 
stimulate the students. During the interviews after the test, all CRT and DRT 
students felt that reciprocal tutoring is like playing a game. All of the DRT 
students found that the system was exciting and fun and some even enjoyed seeing 
their partners struggle in solving a problem. A few of the DRT students said 
that at times they preferred writing the hints themselves to picking a hint 
provided by the menu.

    <TD align=middle>4.78&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><B>4.2 Sub-Tasks</B> 
<P>&nbsp;Reciprocal tutoring, as mentioned before, can be regarded as a 
cooperative learning activity where each agent is responsible for a sub-task in 
accomplishing a complete learning task. Therefore, there are variations of task 
decomposition and sub-task assignments to agents. Some of these variations 
employ a student model, possibly in different ways, for adaptive interaction. 
The nature of the sub-tasks: tutoring, tuteeing, and their combinations, will 
now be examined. 
<P> 
<P>Table 4 shows that some significant differences in the posttest results. LBT 
is 64, ITS is 77 and the average of DRT, CRT, and DRS is 82. Low performance of 
LBT is expected since students only need to watch the computer tutee, expand the 
Diagnosis-Hint-Tree when needed, and choose a hint for the student. This is a 
less intellectually demanding process than tuteeing. In our interviews, most 
students said that they preferred the LBT systems because tutoring is an easy 
task. They agreed that they would learn more by doing the problems themselves 
but enjoyed the passive role. Five out of six LBT students preferred teaching a 
virtual student to teaching a real student because it is easier. All of the 
students liked the hints provided by the system and some of them thought that 
there were not enough hints. Does the low performance of ITS imply that social 
learning systems, or at least reciprocal tutoring systems, are superior to ITSs 
in general? If so, one possible explanation lies in the dual perspectives of 
tutoring in reciprocal tutoring. When the student plays the role of tutor, she 
regards the tutee as her counterpart which involves her in the solution process 
to a degree much larger than in LBT. At the same time the student benefits from 
meta-cognitive activity - taking another person's position to observe the 
problem solving process. More investigation into the cognitive implications of 
these systems will be required before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Support</B> 
<P>&nbsp;The final perspective we investigate is the amount of support that is 
most beneficial to learning. Neither too many learning elements nor too many 
supports are good for students. If there are too many learning elements, the 
students will face roadblocks to learning and will be unable to proceed whereas 
if there are too many supports, students will be inundated with information. 
Supports should be incremental and built upon each other. The PLS is a 
scaffolding tool. On top of it, ITS brings forward an additional support where 
the student receives hints when needed. Another system, SD, is similar to ITS. 
Instead of hiding the student model inside the system, SD allows students to use 
DHT to spot their errors and receive hints from it. Finally, in addition to 
these system supports, the interpersonal supports of peer interactions and 
possible moral support can be generated in DRT and DRS due to the cyber social 
presence. 
<P> 
<P>Table 5 shows that the average performance of the pure scaffolding tool (PLS) 
is 70, adaptive interaction (ITS or SD) is 79, and interpersonal supports (DRT 
or DRS) is 84. All WA students liked the system and thought that they could 
focus better on problem solving when the emphasis on syntax was removed and it 
was convenient to have other facilities, such as checking the solution with 
examples. Most SD students (5 out of 6) thought that the DHT was useful. Three 
preferred direct hints provided by the system (like ITS) and three thought that 
using DHT was helpful. In WA, since there was no hint provided, students 
sometimes could not proceed to other problems in two hours once they had trouble 
with one or two of the problems. Unlike WA, students are less likely to get 
stuck when there is a student model in the system since hints and the needed 
feedback are provided. Also, students may learn more from these hints. The 
performance of interpersonal supports is better than adaptive interaction and we 
suspect that one of the reasons is the effect of interpersonal motivation or 
peer pressure. When we compare the results of tutoring with ITS and the average 
of the four other systems, SD, CRT, DRT, and DRS, which involve learning by 
tutoring, there is some significant difference. This seems to indicate that 
explicit use of the student model by the student is better than hiding it from 
the student.

Future Work</B> 
<P> 
<P>At the outset of this research, we intended to build an individualized LBT 
system. However, due to the enormous complexities encountered in the early 
development, we focused on the design of a distributed social learning system, 
DRS, and selected the domain of acquiring programming skill as the objective of 
our system. We studied how to divide the programming task into sub-tasks: 
designing, implementing, and critiquing. Soon we discovered that the system is 
inevitable to have a student play the role of a critic or teacher unless there 
is a human or computer tutor or the domain is open-ended so that there is no 
need to have a teacher justify the answer or solution. Therefore, instead of 
searching for meaningful ways of decomposing the programming task, we focused on 
the more fundamental reciprocal tutoring paradigm from which the presented 
version of DRT naturally emerged. After analysis of data collected from 
students' using the DRT, we found that a student model could be used as a basis 
for the implementation of a centralized LBT system. Within that framework the 
student model enabled us to build an ITS version of the system and hence the 
CRT. It is interesting to note that the experience of building and using DRT to 
observe students' behavior before the final actual development of LBT mimicked 
the Wizard of Oz process. 
<P> 
<P>Besides cooperative learning, <I>collaborative</I> learning, where two or 
more students work on the same task, without decomposition of the task, is also 
possible for sharing the cognitive load. Collaboration, in the end, may need 
powerful natural language understanding ability to understand students' 
dialogues. Comparing to cooperation, collaboration is a free invitation to 
interact while cooperation is coercive, requiring each member has to complete a 
part of the task to ensure that the process can move on. 
<P> 
<P>During the experimental trials, two additional small trials were performed. 
We asked two students to use an interpreter to solve the same set of problems. 
Both of the students became mired in either syntax or semantics errors for the 
second or third problems and could not continue. The result is indicative of a 
more general cognitive difficulty that occurs in the individual learning process 
without in time feedback. In another trial two students who believed they were 
being asked to work cooperatively on DRT were instead placed on two independent 
CRT systems. Similar tests have been performed using Distributed West (Chan, et 
al., 1992) and Contest-Kids systems (Chan &amp; Lai, 1995). The results suggest 
that either the students trusted us and so they did not intend to distinguish or 
that the restricted and narrow bandwidth of communications made them unable to 
distinguish between the system with and without human agent. It is also possible 
that the student tutor does not have a good model of the computer tutee. If this 
is the case and the tutee is simulated by machine learning methods, the machine 
learning process must be made explicit and understandable to the student tutor, 
so that the process can be beneficial to the student's learning. 
<P> 
<P>Tutoring represents a range of actions, including simple lecturing, 
evaluating and diagnosing the tutee's answers, offering opinions, hints, advice, 
suggestions, and strategies, motivating the student, and even monitoring all 
parts of the learning activities. Although the tutoring activities discussed 
here represent only a small part of this range, they are adequate to promote 
meta-knowledge, such as the strategic knowledge of problem solving and judgment 
knowledge of the performance. This type of knowledge has the potential to foster 
knowledge transfer to novel problems or domains. Models of this kind of 
cognitive development and the measurement of respective learning effects are not 
easy tasks. Still, the preliminary evaluation seems to indicate that reciprocal 
tutoring provides cognitive benefits that could possibly differ from other 
protocols of learning. More data and analysis are needed to answer important 
questions such and whether a human learning companion is better than a virtual 
learning companion, whether intelligent reciprocal tutoring systems are superior 
to intelligent tutoring systems, etc. In such analysis, social presence or 
absence could possibly be a critical factor. 
<P> 
<P>The process of fading is not represented in our model. A fading process 
should be coupled with the supports offered by the environment to reflect the 
changing needs of students. A straightforward way of fading is to have students 
use systems with full supports, then leave out such supports one by one and 
finally students use the primitive language interpreter to perform their tasks. 
Our test and posttest experiments involve only the presence or absence of 
whatever supports the systems have to the same base environment, the 
interpreter. To respect the evolving learning repertoire of students, supports 
should not be singled out to be studied and evaluated without considering how 
they are faded. Nevertheless, this issue is complicated and intriguing since 
there are various kinds of supports in a system which are likely to require 
different fading techniques. 
<P> 
<P>It is difficult to design game-oriented learning activities in which the 
student can sustain motivation while expending effort to accomplish a learning 
task. The preliminary evaluation indicates that the reciprocal tutoring learning 
activity possesses some game-like characteristics. Observation is needed to 
reveal these elements and how they can be incorporated into the student model to 
enhance its motivational effects. Indeed, motivation is desirable in all kinds 
of learning activities. 
<P> 
<P>Reciprocal tutoring interleaves tutoring with tuteeing, or vice versa, 
allowing immediate use of the learned knowledge and meta-knowledge of the 
domain. However, learning may also proceed in two phases: tuteeing followed by 
tutoring. An interesting scenario involves a student who is first tutored by a 
computer tutor and then trains an artificial agent so that its performance 
reaches a level sufficient to defeat another opponent computer agent. Reversing 
these two phases, that is, tutoring followed by tuteeing, is also possible. This 
scenario can also be regarded as a fading process since the computer tutee 
performs a partial modeling process for the student before the student works on 
the task. Our results indicate that learning by tutoring does not perform well 
when used alone. Therefore, this may suggest that learning by tutoring should be 
combined with other forms of learning to generate more effective learning 
paradigms. 
<P> 
<P>We are currently in the process of transporting DRT and CRT to the Internet. 
The presence of DRT and CRT on the Internet will make the systems always 
available to students in their residence halls. A powerful workstation will be 
used as a server running the main program in Lisp. The clients will run Delphi 
on PC and/or SuperCard on Mac to perform the interface functions of PLS. A 
student on line may connect with another student in the same or different campus 
to play DRT. When CRT is converted to the Internet version, it means that a 
virtual learning companion is present on the server so that if there is no other 
student on-line, a virtual learning companion is always available to serve as a 
virtual agent to cooperate. Thus, the scenario is analogous to playing bridge on 
the network, where your partner can be a human or a virtual companion. 
<P>We can also observe how students' social behavior may affect their learning 
and the use of the systems. For example, we can examine whether students prefer 
to work with students they know well or whether weak students will try more than 
one time but sign on as anonymous users. Perhaps some of the students would have 
developed differently if allowed to play with the virtual learning companion 
before with fellow classmates. Data on student preferences can be easily 
captured by the server automatically without labor intensive experiments. 
Furthermore, integration of the real-time and interactive network version of 
these systems on WWW with the usual asynchronous distance learning course with 
the hypertext-based material for introducing basic Lisp and recursion can be 
made available in the same system. 
<P> 
<P>We shall also develop a simple follow up version of DRT on the Internet which 
can also be regarded as a fading phase. Again, the student tutor can see the 
solution and help the student tutee to diagnose the program or to give advice by 
typing comments when queried by the tutee. The student tutee, at the other end, 
only has a menu of the language constructs as reference and key in the program 
solution. The learning process can be regarded as cycling processes of 
conceptualization, construction, reflection, and articulation. The DRT system 
can lead students to learn concepts of recursion in class, experiencing 
construction and reflection in the first phase of reciprocal tutoring. The 
students will then undergo articulation, construction, and reflection in the 
fading phase. 
<P><B>6. Conclusions</B> 
<P>&nbsp;In this paper we have discussed the design of a set of different 
versions of reciprocal tutoring systems. An intelligent tutoring system is a 
specific type of reciprocal tutoring system. An intelligent reciprocal tutoring 
system can be viewed as a product of designing and applying a sequence of 
devices to support student learning. These computer and human supports constrain 
the design and learning space, relate various elements of concern during the 
learning process and place these elements in proper positions in the systems. 
<P>A student model plays a critical role in supporting adaptive interaction. In 
traditional ITS fashion, a student model is used as a supporting component for 
the computer tutor (usually called the tutoring module) and is hidden from the 
student. When the student plays as a tutor to teach another student, the student 
model becomes a tool for the student tutor to manipulate directly in fulfilling 
the responsibility of being a tutor. Furthermore, when the computer assumes the 
role of a tutee, the student model serves as an active and autonomous agent 
inside the system. This means that simulating a typical student or a virtual 
learning companion is technically equivalent to student modeling; but operated 
in a proactive way, rather than in a reactive way as in most ITSs. The various 
uses of student modeling prove that a student model gets to the very soul of 
cooperative learning systems, dismissing doubts of its importance. (McCalla, 
1990; Palthepu, Greer, &amp; McCalla 1991; Chan, 1991). Student modeling will 
certainly not pass unnoticed in reciprocal tutoring or, more generally, in 
cooperative learning. 
<P> 
<P>Placing the student in the role of tutor is a methodology common to many 
distributed cooperative learning in problem solving domains and is potentially 
applicable to all domains in which advice is needed during the learning process. 
The model of reciprocal tutoring is a simple and powerful idea and its 
significance in distributed learning environments will be as important as the 
intelligent tutoring system model in centralized learning environments.
